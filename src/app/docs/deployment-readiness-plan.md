# Deployment Readiness Plan - Discharger

## Overview
This document outlines the critical tasks needed to make Discharger production-ready for deployment. Focus is on backend stability, code quality, and deployment requirements while a teammate handles the discharge feature implementation.

## Critical Path to Production

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY - Must Complete Before Deployment

#### 1. Backend Data Persistence Verification
**Status**: üî¥ Needs Audit
- [ ] Test patient creation/update/deletion flow
- [ ] Verify patient data saves correctly to Supabase `patients` table
- [ ] Test discharge summary persistence to `discharge_summaries` table
- [ ] Verify Row-Level Security (RLS) policies work correctly
- [ ] Test patient-user association and data isolation
- [ ] Validate document-patient relationships in database

#### 2. Code Quality & Linting
**Status**: üî¥ Needs Checking
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues
- [ ] Run `npm run check-types` and resolve TypeScript errors
- [ ] Fix any console errors/warnings in development
- [ ] Ensure no unused imports or variables
- [ ] Review and fix any TODO/FIXME comments

#### 3. Authentication & Security
**Status**: üî¥ Needs Testing
- [ ] Test Clerk authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify JWT token handling between Clerk and Supabase
- [ ] Test user session persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Verify protected routes work correctly
- [ ] Test user profile creation in Supabase on first login

#### 4. Document Management System
**Status**: üî¥ Needs Testing
- [ ] Test file upload to Supabase Storage
- [ ] Verify signed URL generation for secure file access
- [ ] Test document deletion and storage cleanup
- [ ] Verify document metadata persistence
- [ ] Test PDF preview functionality

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important for Stable Production

#### 5. Environment & Configuration
**Status**: üü° Needs Review
- [ ] Document all required environment variables
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with all needed vars
- [ ] Verify production environment variable setup
- [ ] Test with production-like environment variables
- [ ] Ensure no hardcoded secrets in codebase

#### 6. Database Schema & Migrations
**Status**: üü° Needs Verification
- [ ] Review current database schema in `src/models/Schema.ts`
- [ ] Test database migrations with `npm run db:migrate`
- [ ] Verify all foreign key relationships
- [ ] Test database seed data (if needed for production)
- [ ] Verify backup and recovery procedures

#### 7. Error Handling & Monitoring
**Status**: üü° Needs Implementation
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries in React components
- [ ] Implement API error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add logging for critical operations
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network failures, API timeouts)
- [ ] Verify error states in UI components

### üü¢ NICE TO HAVE - Post-MVP Improvements

#### 8. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Test app performance with large document sets
- [ ] Optimize bundle size if needed
- [ ] Test memory usage and potential leaks
- [ ] Add loading states for better UX

#### 9. Testing Coverage
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical backend operations
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
- [ ] All HIGH PRIORITY items completed
- [ ] Environment variables configured for production
- [ ] Database migrations applied to production DB
- [ ] Supabase project configured with correct settings
- [ ] Clerk authentication configured for production domain
- [ ] Storage bucket permissions set correctly

### Deployment Process
1. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
2. **Production Environment Test**
   - Test with production environment variables
   - Verify all external service connections
   - Test authentication flow on production domain

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - [ ] Test user registration/login
   - [ ] Test patient creation
   - [ ] Test document upload
   - [ ] Test discharge summary generation (basic functionality)
   - [ ] Verify data persistence across sessions

## Current Architecture Health Check

### ‚úÖ Known Working Components
- Next.js 15 App Router setup
- Clerk authentication integration
- Supabase client configuration
- Basic UI components and navigation
- File upload system architecture

### ‚ùì Components Needing Verification
- Patient data persistence flow
- Discharge summary storage
- Document processing pipeline
- Vector embeddings (if being used)
- RLS policies enforcement

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues from CLAUDE.md
- Action menu cursor refocus issues (non-critical)
- Potential Date/string type mismatches
- Performance concerns with large document sets

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **New User Journey**
   - Sign up ‚Üí Create patient ‚Üí Upload document ‚Üí Generate summary
2. **Returning User Journey**
   - Login ‚Üí Access existing patients ‚Üí View documents ‚Üí Generate new summary
3. **Error Scenarios**
   - Network failures during upload
   - Invalid authentication tokens
   - Database connection issues

### Backend API Testing
- Test all endpoints in `/src/app/api/`
- Verify request/response schemas
- Test authentication middleware
- Validate error responses

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss**: Patient/discharge summary data not persisting
2. **Security**: Authentication bypass or data access violations
3. **File System**: Document upload failures or orphaned files

### üü° Medium Risk Areas
1. **Performance**: Slow loading with many documents
2. **User Experience**: Poor error handling or confusing UI states
3. **Integration**: LLM API failures or quota exceeded

### üü¢ Low Risk Areas
1. **UI Polish**: Minor styling or UX improvements
2. **Feature Enhancement**: Advanced discharge features (handled by teammate)
3. **Optimization**: Code splitting or bundle size improvements

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Run comprehensive backend data persistence audit
2. Fix all linting and TypeScript errors
3. Test authentication flow thoroughly
4. Verify document upload/storage system

### Pre-Launch Actions (Next Week)
1. Complete environment variable documentation
2. Test with production-like configuration
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Conduct final pre-deployment testing

### Post-Launch Monitoring
1. Monitor error rates and user feedback
2. Track performance metrics
3. Watch for authentication or data issues
4. Be ready for quick fixes if needed
